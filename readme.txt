This is my response to the LRU challenge posted on box.net. I finished last month but never got it submitted.

Box.net hires interviewstreet.com to handle the challenges, but interviewstreet.com really sucks!

It passed the sample test. I could not test against all the test cases since I could not download the cases from interviewstreet.com.
